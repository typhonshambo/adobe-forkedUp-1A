# Document Intelligence Solution

## Overview

This solution extracts relevant content from PDF document collections based on user personas and specific tasks. The system combines semantic analysis with domain-specific keyword matching to identify the most pertinent information.

## Technical Approach

### Document Processing
PDF text extraction uses PyMuPDF with pdfplumber fallback for compatibility across different document formats.

### Content Segmentation
Documents are divided into logical sections using header detection and content structure analysis.

### Relevance Analysis
The system employs a two-stage ranking process:
1. Semantic embedding similarity using sentence transformers
2. Cross-encoder reranking for improved precision

### Domain-Specific Enhancement
Keyword boosting is applied based on the target persona to improve relevance scoring for domain-specific terms.

## Technical Implementation

## Implementation Details

### Core Libraries
- PyMuPDF, pdfplumber: PDF text extraction
- sentence-transformers: Semantic similarity analysis
- scikit-learn: Cosine similarity computation
- NLTK: Text preprocessing
- PyTorch: Machine learning framework

### Processing Steps
1. PDF text extraction with fallback handling
2. Document segmentation into logical sections
3. Semantic embedding generation
4. Query-section similarity calculation
5. Cross-encoder reranking of top candidates
6. Domain-specific score adjustment
7. Output formatting and validation

## Performance Requirements
- Processing time: Under 60 seconds for 3-5 documents
- Memory footprint: Less than 1GB
- Compatible with standard x86_64 architecture

## Output Structure
The system generates JSON output containing document metadata, ranked sections with importance scores, and page references for source material.
